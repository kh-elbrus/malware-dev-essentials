# RED TEAM Operator: Malware Development Essentials Course

## Course Overview

I recently completed an essesntial Mal Dev course. This course covered a comprehensive range of topics designed to enhance skills in malware development, payload obfuscation, and evading antivirus solutions.

- **PE Compilation**

### Droppers
- **Where to Store Payloads?**
- **Storing Payloads in Code Section**
- **Data Section as a Container**
- **Payloads in Resource Section**

### Obfuscation and Hiding
- **Encoding and Encryption**
  - Payload Encoding
  - Encrypting Payloads - XOR
  - Encrypting Payloads - AES
- **Antivirus vs Call Obfuscation**
- **Implementing Function Call Obfuscation**

## Final Assignment

### Assignment Overview
The final assignment involved turning a custom dropper into a stealthy version with the following enhancements:
- **Encrypt All Strings**
- **Obfuscate All Function Calls**
- **Change XOR to AES** (I used XOR btw)

### Real-life Application
- **Think about how you could hide your encrypted payload behind an image.**
- **Build a dropper, which hosts its payload in a separate encrypted file (on disk or on a file share).** Hint: Use `CreateFile()` and `ReadFile()`; example code.
